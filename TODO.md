# Beacon TODO: Usability, Demo, and Polish

## Goals
- Make Beacon more polished, usable, approachable, and demo-ready for users and potential customers.

## TODOs

- [ ] Create a GUI configuration editor for all major config files (market data, exchange, trading, risk, products).
- [ ] Add a simple launcher script for end-to-end demo (build, run, visualize).
- [ ] Provide sample configs and easy switching between them (e.g., for md_generator).
- [ ] Add a true backtest mode (historical data replay, results export).
- [ ] Improve documentation: quickstart, architecture, plugin guide, FAQ.
- [ ] Add visualizations (latency, PnL, order flow) for demos.
- [ ] Make algorithm plug-in workflow seamless (templates, hot-reload, examples).
- [ ] Add error handling and user-friendly messages throughout.
- [ ] Provide pre-built binaries and installer for easy onboarding.
- [ ] Record and publish demo videos showing Beacon in action.
- [ ] Gather real tick-to-trade latency stats on multiple hardware platforms.
- [ ] Add a config/profile manager for quick switching between setups.
- [ ] Add a web dashboard for monitoring and control (optional).
- [ ] Collect user feedback and iterate on UX.
