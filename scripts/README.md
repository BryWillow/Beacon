This directory contains scripts used for building, releasing, and managing the Beacon project. The scripts are organized into subdirectories based on their purpose:

- **build/**: Contains scripts for building individual components of the project.
- **release/**: Contains scripts for release-related tasks, such as generating release notes and managing version control.

Each subdirectory includes its own README file with more details about the scripts it contains.
